# ⚙️ MARK LS — JARVIS
### The Ultimate Cross-Platform Personal AI Assistant — By karakas

## ✨ Overview

MARK LS is where the assistant stops being a tool and starts being a presence. It remembers yesterday's conversation, watches the topics you care about, and speaks first when it has something worth saying. The goal of this build was continuity — JARVIS should feel like it never fully left, even after you close it.

It's not just an assistant — it's an extension of your digital life.
